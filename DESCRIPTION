Description: DrugInter, an R package dissecting drug interaction from higher order combination. DrugInter rank drug pair by calculating Kullback-Leibler divergence of variablesâ€™ depth distribution difference to capture the attractiveness between two variables as interaction strength. Effectiveness was evaluated on a compiled dataset by comparing the correlation between true wet lab interaction strength and model predicted one. DrugInter provide most basic parameters such as tree-based routes for random forest, thus enabling further comprehensive explanations and individual expansions, and could be used in general pair-wide variable interaction study.
